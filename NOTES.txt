## Sample game

8 / . 5 4 . 9 - . X - . X - . 5 / . 5 3 . 6 3 . 9 / . 9 / X

## Advancing frames

For frames 1-9:
  A strike (first_ball_score = 10) advances to the immediately next frame
  Otherwise the frame advances after two balls have been rolled.

## Scoring a bowling frame

-> Roll first ball for frame

If first ball knocks down all 10 pins...
  [!] Strike
   :  Frame score will equal 10 + the next two rolled balled scores (regardless of what frame they're in)
Otherwise
  -> Roll second ball for frame

  If second ball knocks down all remaining pins...
    [!] Spare
     :  Frame score will equal 10 + the next rolled ball score (regardless of what frame it's in)
  Otherwise
    [!] Open Frame
     :  Frame score equals the number of pins knocked down in the frame. (first_roll + second_roll)
